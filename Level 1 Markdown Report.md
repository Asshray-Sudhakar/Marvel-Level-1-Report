# **TASK 1: 3D Printing**

**Objective:** Understand the working of a 3D printer, check out the online resources. Understand what's an STL file, and then learn to slice it. Learn about bed temperature, and other printer settings. Finally get an STL file from the internet, and slice it and put it for print.

**Outcomes & Learnings:**

1. **PLA (Poly-Lactic Acid)** is the most used material for 3D printing, it is derived from renewable feedstock like corn and sugarcane also it breaks down thousands of times faster than other petroleum-based plastics.
2. **Bed temperature:** PLA/PLA+ can be printed on an unheated bed, for best results we recommend and a bed temp of **between 50¬∞C - 60¬∞C**.
3. PLA prints best when rapidly cooled with the aid of your extruder's fan. This will ensure a clean, crisp layers with neat details. For the best surface resolution possible, set the extruder fan speed to 100%.
4. **Printing Speed:** printing at 55mm/s or slower yields great results. It represents for us the sweet spot between print speed and achieving great surface resolution.
5. **Post Printing Procedures:**\
**a. Joining 3D printed parts:**  
    Cyanoacrylate glue (superglue) or two-stage epoxies are a great choice when joining PLA parts. \
**b. Painting:**\
Almost all 3D printed parts (with the exception of Nylon and PETG) can be easily painted.\
**c. Sanding** 
 PLA parts with progressively finer grades of sandpaper can result in super smooth surface finishes, but sanding process should be done slowly to prevent parts from breaking and melting because of the friction.

**Outcomes & Learnings:**

1. **Working of the Ultrasonic sensor:**

![](https://github.com/Asshray-Sudhakar/Marvel-Task-1-Images/blob/main/Ultrasonic%20sensor.jpg?raw=true)

The term "ultrasonic" refers to frequencies higher than 20 kHz, which are inaudible to humans because they exceed the upper limit of the human hearing range. Ultrasonic sensors typically have two cylindrical components protruding outward: a transmitter (T) and a receiver (R). The transmitter emits ultrasonic sound waves, which interact with an object in front of the sensor and reflect back to the receiver.

The distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the object is calculated based on the time it takes for the reflected ultrasonic wave to reach the receiver. The formula used for this calculation is:

ùëë=ùë†‚ãÖùë°

where:

- ùëë = Distance between the object and the ultrasonic sensor
- _s_ = Speed of the ultrasonic wave signal
- _t_ = Time taken by the reflected signal to reach the receiver

To increase the range and coverage area of the ultrasonic sensor, it can be mounted on a servo motor, allowing it to rotate. This setup enables the sensor to act as a radar, scanning a wider area and providing better distance measurements.

# **TASK 10: Speed control of DC motor using L298N driver**

**Objective:** Understand the control DC motors using the L298N motor driver and the Arduino board. Using an UNO and H-Bridge L298N motor driver, control the speed of a 5V motor.

**Methodology:**  
For this project we‚Äôll need the below components: 

![](https://github.com/Asshray-Sudhakar/Marvel-Task-1-Images/blob/main/Components.png?raw=true)

The connections made are as follows:

| Potentiometer | Arduino UNO |
| --- | --- |
| Ground | GND |
| Power | 5v  |
| Central pin | A0  |

| L298N motor driver | Components |

| GND | \-ve of 9 v power supply |
| 12V | +ve of 9 V power supply |

**Outcomes & Learnings:**

1. **Working of a L298N motor driver:**

**![](https://github.com/Asshray-Sudhakar/Marvel-Task-1-Images/blob/main/L289%20Motor%20Driver.png?raw=true)**

I learned about the various ports and pins present in the L298N motor driver.

2. **Speed Controlling using an L298N driver:**  
    The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing its input voltage. A widely used technique to accomplish this is Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). PWM is a technique in which the average value of the input voltage is adjusted by sending a series of ON-OFF pulses. This average voltage is proportional to the width of the pulses, which is referred to as the Duty Cycle. The higher the duty cycle, the higher the average voltage applied to the DC motor, resulting in an increase in motor speed. The shorter the duty cycle, the lower the average voltage applied to the DC motor, resulting in a decrease in motor speed.  
    **_Note_**: The pins in L298N driver which are responsible for speed control are ENA & ENB, these pins should be compulsorily connected to the PWM (~) ports of the Arduino UNO, so that PWM takes place.

# **TASK 14: K-Map & Deriving Logic Gates**

**Objective:** Determine the Karnaugh map and make a burglar alarm using simple logic circuits. The buzzer or led blinks when certain conditions are met, you can use push buttons for the door and key.

**Methodology:**  
Since this is a burglar alarm, it should start ringing in case of un-authorised access i.e. when the door opens in the absence of the key. So, let‚Äôs make the following assumptions:  
We denote state of: 
- Door by, ‚ÄòD‚Äô. Open door is denoted by 1, closed door is denoted by 0.
- Key by, ‚ÄòK‚Äô. If key is NOT put on the door it‚Äôs denoted by 0 and if key is put on the door it‚Äôs denoted by 1.
- The burglar alarm is denoted by, ‚ÄòA‚Äô where 1 means the alarm is activated and 0 means the alarm is off.

So, the alarm works on the basis of the given truth table: ![](https://github.com/Asshray-Sudhakar/Marvel-Task-1-Images/blob/main/Generated%20Truth%20Table.png?raw=true)

K-map obtained from the given truth table is:

# **TASK 16: Datasheets report writing**

**Objective:** Study the datasheet of L293D motor driver and write a report on it. Specify about the ICs used in L293D, PWM, H-bridge etc.

**Outcomes & Learnings:**

![](https://github.com/Asshray-Sudhakar/Marvel-Task-1-Images/blob/main/Block%20Diagram.png?raw=true)
1. The L293D is a dual-channel H-Bridge motor driver capable of driving a pair of DC motors or a single stepper motor. This means it can drive up to two motors individually which makes it ideal for building a two-wheeled robotic platform. The **L293D** is most often used to drive motors, but can also be **used** **to drive any inductive load such as a relay solenoid or large switching power transistor**. It is capable of driving four solenoids, four uni-directional DC motors, two bi-directional DC motors or one stepper motor. The IC also includes built-in kick-back diodes to prevent damage when the motor is de-energized.

The L293D IC has a supply range of 4.5V to 36V and is capable of 1.2A peak output current per channel, so it works very well with most of our motors.

| Components | Range |
| --- | --- |
| Motor output voltage | 4.5V - 36V |
| Logic input voltage | 5V  |
| Output Current per channel | 600mA |
| Peak Output Current per Channell | 1.2A |

The following images shows the L293D pins:

2. PWM ‚Äì to control speed:  
    The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing its input voltage. A common technique to do this is to use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). PWM is a technique where the average value of the input voltage is adjusted by sending a series of ON-OFF pulses. The average voltage is proportional to the width of the pulses known as the Duty Cycle. The average voltage is proportional to the width of the pulses known as the Duty Cycle.
3. H-Bridge ‚Äì to control the rotation direction:  
    The spinning direction of a DC motor can be controlled by changing the polarity of its input voltage. A common technique for doing this is to use an H-bridge. An H-bridge circuit consists of four switches with the motor in the centre forming an H-like arrangement. Closing two specific switches at a time reverses the polarity of the voltage applied to the motor. This causes a change in the spinning direction of the motor.
